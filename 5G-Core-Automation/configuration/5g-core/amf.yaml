# AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) Configuration
# =============================================================
# AMF is like the "gatekeeper" of the 5G network
# It handles:
# - Mobile phone registration (like checking in)
# - Moving between cell towers (mobility)
# - Security and authentication

amf:
  # Network interfaces
  ngap:
    # N2 interface: Connection between gNB (cell tower) and AMF
    # This is where the cell tower talks to the core network
    - addr: 192.168.0.10        # AMF IP address
      port: 38412                # Standard NGAP port

  # Metrics for monitoring (like health dashboard)
  metrics:
    - addr: 0.0.0.0              # Listen on all interfaces
      port: 9091                 # Prometheus metrics port

  # GUAMI: Globally Unique AMF Identifier
  # Think of this as AMF's unique ID card
  guami:
    plmn_id:
      mcc: 001                   # Mobile Country Code (001 = test network)
      mnc: 01                    # Mobile Network Code (01 = test operator)
    amf_id:
      region: 2                  # AMF region
      set: 1                     # AMF set
      pointer: 0                 # AMF pointer

  # TAI: Tracking Area Identity
  # Like a "zone" or "area" in the network
  # Mobile phones register to a tracking area
  tai:
    - plmn_id:
        mcc: 001
        mnc: 01
      tac: 1                     # Tracking Area Code

  # Supported PLMNs (networks) and slices
  plmn_support:
    - plmn_id:
        mcc: 001
        mnc: 01
      s_nssai:
        # Network slices (different types of service)
        - sst: 1                 # SST 1 = eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband - normal internet)
          sd: 010203             # Slice Differentiator (optional)
        - sst: 2                 # SST 2 = URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low Latency - for critical apps)
          sd: 112233

  # Security settings
  security:
    integrity_order: [NIA2, NIA1, NIA0]     # Encryption algorithms (strongest first)
    ciphering_order: [NEA2, NEA1, NEA0]     # Integrity algorithms

  # Network Function (NF) connections
  # These are other 5G components AMF talks to
  sbi:
    # Service Based Interface - how 5G components communicate
    - addr: 192.168.0.10
      port: 7777

  # NRF: Network Repository Function (like a phone book of services)
  nrf:
    - addr: 192.168.0.20
      port: 7777

# Simple Explanation:
# ==================
# AMF is the first point of contact when your phone connects to 5G
#
# When you turn on your phone:
# 1. Phone → Cell Tower (gNB) → AMF (via N2/NGAP interface)
# 2. AMF checks: "Who are you?" (authentication)
# 3. AMF checks: "Where are you?" (tracking area)
# 4. AMF says: "OK, you're registered!"
# 5. Now you can make calls and use data
#
# Think of AMF as the reception desk at a hotel:
# - Checks your ID (authentication)
# - Gives you a room (assigns you to tracking area)
# - Remembers where you are (mobility management)
